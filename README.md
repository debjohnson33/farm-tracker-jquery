# Farm Tracker

Usage

Welcome to the Farm Tracker! Users can add a farm (or more than one) with different areas and then add animals. If your female animal is pregnant, you can also document that with the "bred date" and "estimated due date." 

Installation

Simply clone this repository

Then execute

	$ bundle install

Then run 

	$ rake db:migrate
	$ rake db:seed

From there, run
	
	$ rails s

If everything is installed correctly you should see an output notifying you that rails is running locally. Copy http://localhost:3000 and paste it into your browser window. From there you are free to play around and add your own farm.
